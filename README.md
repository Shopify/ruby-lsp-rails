# Rails add-on

The Rails add-on is a [Ruby LSP](https://github.com/Shopify/ruby-lsp) [add-on](https://shopify.github.io/ruby-lsp/add-ons.html) for extra [Rails editor features](https://shopify.github.io/ruby-lsp/rails-add-on.html).

## Installation

If you haven't already done so, you'll need to first [set up Ruby LSP](https://shopify.github.io/ruby-lsp/#usage).

As of v0.3.0, Ruby LSP will automatically include the Ruby LSP Rails add-on in its custom bundle when a Rails app is detected.
There is no need to add the gem to your bundle.
