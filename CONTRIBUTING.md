For general information about developing, refer to the to the [documentation](https://github.com/Shopify/ruby-lsp/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#debugging-with-vs-code) for Ruby LSP itself.

### Manually testing a change

The repo includes a dummy Rails app in `test/dummy`. If you're developing a feature, you can add new code to it for testing.

To test with a real Rails application, you can add a Gemfile entry for `ruby-lsp-rails` and point it to your local checkout:

```ruby
gem "ruby-lsp-rails", path: "../ruby-lsp-rails"
```

Or to a branch in your fork:

```ruby
gem "ruby-lsp-rails", github: "USERNAME/ruby-lsp-rails", branch: "your_branch"
```

### Running the test suite

The test suite can be executed by running

```shell
bin/rails test
```
