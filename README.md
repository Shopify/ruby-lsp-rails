# Rails addon

The Rails addon is a [Ruby LSP](https://github.com/Shopify/ruby-lsp) [addon](https://shopify.github.io/ruby-lsp/addons.html) for extra [Rails editor features](https://shopify.github.io/ruby-lsp/rails-addon.html).

## Installation

If you haven't already done so, you'll need to first [set up Ruby LSP](https://shopify.github.io/ruby-lsp/#usage).

As of v0.3.0, Ruby LSP will automatically include the Ruby LSP Rails addon in its custom bundle when a Rails app is detected.
There is no need to add the gem to your bundle.
